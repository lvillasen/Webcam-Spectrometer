# Webcam-Spectrometer
This web application demonstrates how to build a simple, low-cost optical spectrometer using a manually focused commercial webcam as the detector.

The setup includes a 3D-printed enclosure that mounts directly onto the webcam, a narrow slit covered with a thin layer of wax paper for light diffusion, and a small piece of a DVD that serves as a diffraction grating.
